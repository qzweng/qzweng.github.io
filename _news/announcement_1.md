Openings: I'm currently recruiting highly motivated students who can intern in [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://shlab.org.cn) for 3+ months.  If you're excited about advancing AI through <u>large language models</u>, please contact me along with your CV or transcripts.  Experience with machine learning systems, CUDA programming, or reinforcement learning is a plus but not required.
