ðŸ’¡**Openings**: I'm currently recruiting highly motivated students who can intern in Shanghai for 3+ months.  If you're excited about advancing AI through <u>large language models</u> (e.g., InternLM [[en](https://www.shine.cn/news/metro/2307085932/)/[zh](https://www.shlab.org.cn/news/5443847)]), please fill in this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=UkEdbNA5ykSI2bjW3coHCCInRX1CDbtBh-HflA1h_pRUNjZGTzlPWEc0NkIzWkFZMjZIT0g2VVA1OC4u).  Experience with <u>deep learning frameworks</u>, <u>distributed systems</u>, or <u>reinforcement learning</u> is a plus but not required.
