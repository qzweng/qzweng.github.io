ðŸ’¡**Openings**: I'm currently recruiting highly motivated students who can intern in Shanghai for 3+ months.  If you're excited about advancing AI through <u>LLM</u>/<u>MLLM</u>/<u>DiT</u>, please drop me an email with your CV or fill in this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=UkEdbNA5ykSI2bjW3coHCCInRX1CDbtBh-HflA1h_pRUNjZGTzlPWEc0NkIzWkFZMjZIT0g2VVA1OC4u).  Experience with <u>deep learning frameworks</u>, <u>distributed systems</u>, or <u>CUDA programming</u> is a plus but not required.
