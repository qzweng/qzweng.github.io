Openings: I'm currently recruiting highly motivated students who can intern in [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://shlab.org.cn) for 3+ months.  If you're excited about advancing AI through <u>large language models</u> ([INTERN](https://www.shine.cn/news/metro/2307085932/), [InternLM2](https://www.shlab.org.cn/news/5443847)), please contact [me](mailto:qwengaa@cse.ust.hk) along with your CV or transcripts.  Experience with machine learning systems, CUDA programming, or reinforcement learning is a plus but not required.
