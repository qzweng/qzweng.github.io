💡**Openings**: Calling highly motivated students interning in Shanghai for 3+ months. Passionate about large AI models (e.g., <u>LLM</u>, <u>VLM</u>, <u>DiT</u>)? Please send your CV to my email.  Experience with <u>DL frameworks</u>, <u>distributed systems</u>, or <u>CUDA programming</u> is a plus but not required.
