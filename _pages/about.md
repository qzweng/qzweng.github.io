My research interests broadly span AI Infrastructure, Machine Learning Systems, and Cloud Computing, with a special focus on **GPU cluster optimization** and **large-scale model training, inference, and fine-tuning**.

I have been leading the AI Infra team at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, China Telecom ([TeleAI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-institute-of-artificial-intelligence-china-telecom-teleai/)) since 2024. Before that, I joined [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) in 2023 after earning my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2022, where I was advised by Prof. [Wei Wang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/). As a Research Intern at [Alibaba](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US), I worked on cluster management for over two years (2020). I hold a B.Eng. degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) and also spent time studying at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) in 2015.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
