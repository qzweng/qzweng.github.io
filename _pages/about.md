My research interests encompass AI Infrastructure, Machine Learning Systems, and Cloud Computing, with a particular emphasis on **enhancing GPU cluster efficiency** and **optimizing training performance for large-scale generative models**, such as large language models (LLMs), multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), and diffusion transformers (DiTs).

Since 2024, I have been **leading the AI Infra Team** at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, China Telecom ([TeleAI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-institute-of-artificial-intelligence-china-telecom-teleai/)), where I oversee initiatives to advance AI system capabilities. Prior to this, I joined the [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) in 2022 as a Systems Researcher, contributing to the systems for **[large language model](https://www.shlab.org.cn/news/5443847) training and inference**. Earlier, I gained valuable experience as a Research Intern at [Alibaba Cloud & Alibaba Group](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US), where I focused on **GPU cluster management and AI job scheduling** for over two years, beginning in 2020.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2022, under the guidance of Prof. [Wei Wang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/). I also hold a B.Eng. degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2017 and enriched my academic journey with a study period at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) in 2015.
